## Status Update 1/15/2019  

While many papers discuss the types of measures used, it is not often that the actual questions or stimuli used are present within the paper, supplmentary material, or links to external sites. Sometimes questionnaires are proprietary and must be purchased. As such, based on the paper by itself, it does not seem possible to reproduce the methods of most research articles that were reviewed this far.  

We would like to come up with a better way to organize and code these papers so that we can fully understand the types of behaviors that are used in developmental research methods.
