Parental and child sociodemographic characteristics
were collected through questionnaires administered
by interviewers. 

Children’s cognitive and motor development at
4 years was assessed through the McCarthy Scales
of Children’s Abilities (MSCA; MacCarthy, 1972). In person

Information on children’s ADHD difficulties was
gathered through the ADHD test (ADHDT; Gilliam,
1995), which was completed by the participants’
mothers.

We utilized data from a longitudinal study on student
achievement and cognitive ability conducted
in Berlin, Germany from the beginning of the
school year 2008–2009 until the end of school year
2009–2010. 

We used data from the pretest and the
posttest (cognitive abilities and student achievement),
as well as the second testing session (IE) that
took place on average 41 days after the pretest
(SD = 6.24). 

We
used an 18-item measure of IE (see Wilhelm et al.,
2003 for details). Students rated these items on a 6-
point scale ranging from 1 (do not agree at all) to 6

Fluid and crystallized intelligence were measured
at pretest and posttest with the Berlin Test of
Fluid and Crystallized Intelligence (BEFKI; Wilhelm,
Schroeders, & Schipolowski, 2014). Fluid
intelligence was measured with three subtests for
figural, verbal, and numeric content (16 items each).

Mathematics
achievement was measured by two tests of the
domains “number” and “functional relations.”
German achievement was measured by two tests
of reading and listening comprehension

We used data on school grades in the subjects
German and mathematics that were
obtained at pretest and posttest, and recoded so
that higher values indicated better grades.

The Family and Child Experiences Survey (FACES)  

we focus on the first two waves of
data collection (Fall 2009 and Spring 2010), as these
waves capture the Head Start year. 

During the spring of 2010, parents were asked,
“Approximately how many days has [CHILD]
been absent since the beginning of the school
year?” 

First, children’s language skills were measured using
the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (Dunn &
Dunn, 1997; Fall a = .97 and Spring a = .95).

 Next, two subscales from the Woodcock–
Johnson (Woodcock, McGrew, & Mather, 2001), the
Letter Word Identification (Fall 2009: a = .85 and
Spring 2010: a = .83) and Spelling Word (Fall 2009:
a = .79 and Spring 2010: a = .83), were administered
to children to capture their literacy skills.

 Finally, children’s math
skills were directly assessed with the Woodcock–
Johnson Applied Problems subscale et al., 2001; Fall 2009: a = .87 and Spring 2010:
a = .89).

During the spring of 2010, all Head Start classrooms
were observed and rated on the Classroom
Assessment Scoring System (CLASS; Pianta, La
Paro, & Hamre, 2008).

The study took place at an elementary school on
the Tulalip Indian Reservation in the Puget Sound
region of Washington State. 

For the self-report
Self-Representation and Academic Achievement in Children 1101
assessments, two procedures (role playing (K-2) and
paper questionnaire (3-5)) were utilized

both
kindergarten to second-grade students and thirdto
fifth-grade students moved to a desk with a
laptop computer and were tested one on one utilizing
the Child IAT procedure 

Rates of absenteeism from school records were
computed as a total number of excused absences,
unexcused absences, and “tardies” for each student.

On a scale from 0 (not
really/never) to either 4 (all of the time for some
items) or 5 (more than once or twice a week for other
items), teachers rated each student in their class on
four items (

End-of-year report cards were obtained for all
participants. Grades were averaged for K–5
1102 Cvencek, Fryberg, Covarrubias, and Meltzoff
students on a scale from 1 (area of concern) to 4 (exceeds
standards) in the following subjects: mathematics,
reading, writing, science, social studies, art,
music, and physical education (a = .92).

For each domain, we developed explanations for
nine phenomena that were broadly applicable to
either all animals or all things.

Participants either evaluated all nine biology
items or all nine physics items.

This report is drawn from a larger longitudinal
investigation of adolescent social development in
familial and peer contexts. 

AAI and Q-Set (Ages 14 and 24)
This structured interview probes individuals’
descriptions of their childhood relationships with
parents in both abstract terms and with requests
for specific supporting memories

Maternal Supportive Behavior (Ages 13 and 16)
Adolescents participated in an 8-min supportive
behavior interaction task with their mothers

Parental Psychological Control (Ages 14 and 16/17)
Adolescents completed the Psychological Control
versus Psychological Autonomy subscale of the
Childhood Report of Parenting Behavior Inventory
assessing the degree to which mothers and fathers
use guilt, love withdrawal, or other autonomyundermining
methods to control adolescents’
behavior 

Interparental Hostile Conflict (Age 13)
Hostile conflict between parents was reported by
both parents 

Popularity (Age 14)
Adolescent popularity was assessed using a limited
nomination sociometric procedure. 

Close Peer Supportive Behavior (Ages 14, 16/17)
Adolescents participated in an 8-min interaction
task with their closest friend,

Close Peer Collaborative Behavior and Hostile Behavior
(Ages 14, 16/17)
Each adolescent-close peer dyad participated in
an 8-min videotaped task 

Observed Romantic Partner Supportive Behavior (Age
21)
Late adolescents participated in an 8-min interaction
task with their romantic partner

Romantic Partner Autonomy Support (Age 21)
Autonomy support when disagreeing was
assessed via romantic partner reports on the CTS

 Approximately
two thirds of the children watched videos in
which informants made claims about events; after
each video children judged the likelihood that those
events could really occur.  Belief ratings were scored such that
0 = very sure the event could not happen, 0.33 = a
little sure the event could not happen, 0.66 = a little
sure the event could happen, and 1.00 = very sure
the event could happen.

The final third of the
sample served as a baseline comparison group—these children
were asked identical questions about whether
the events could really occur but did not receive
testimony.

One hundred and thirty caregiver–toddler dyads
were recruited via flyers and word of mouth from
the New York City metropolitan area or the Central
District of Israel. The Americans participated at a
children’s museum or in a laboratory setting, and
all Israelis participated in their homes.

Coviewing Task: The dyads viewed a slideshow consisting of 12
images; The stimuli were presented via keynote
A camera was positioned above
the participants’ head giving a bird’s-eye view of
the area between the participants and the computer
screen.

Story Construction Task: Caregivers were shown to a child-friendly table
and chair set, and told, “Please use these tiles any
way you like to create a story for your child.” They were then handed the stack of tiles.  The interactions were recorded using a
camera positioned to provide a bird’s-eye view.

video-recorded observational assessment of parent–
child interaction and an audio-recorded standardized
interview that lasted approximately 1.5 hr.

A free play task was used to obtain an observational
assessment of mother–infant and father–infant
interaction. Each parent was instructed to play
with the infant for 10 min in whatever manner and
using whichever toys, they used when they usually
played together. The session was video recorded
and coded using the fourth edition of the Emotional
Availability (EA) Scales (Biringen, 2008). EA refers
to the capacity of a dyad to share an emotionally
healthy relationship 

Mothers and fathers were interviewed separately
using an adaptation of the Parent Development
Interview (PDI
