Parental and child sociodemographic characteristics
were collected through questionnaires administered
by interviewers. 

Children’s cognitive and motor development at
4 years was assessed through the McCarthy Scales
of Children’s Abilities (MSCA; MacCarthy, 1972). In person

Information on children’s ADHD difficulties was
gathered through the ADHD test (ADHDT; Gilliam,
1995), which was completed by the participants’
mothers.

We utilized data from a longitudinal study on student
achievement and cognitive ability conducted
in Berlin, Germany from the beginning of the
school year 2008–2009 until the end of school year
2009–2010. 

We used data from the pretest and the
posttest (cognitive abilities and student achievement),
as well as the second testing session (IE) that
took place on average 41 days after the pretest
(SD = 6.24). 

We
used an 18-item measure of IE (see Wilhelm et al.,
2003 for details). Students rated these items on a 6-
point scale ranging from 1 (do not agree at all) to 6

Fluid and crystallized intelligence were measured
at pretest and posttest with the Berlin Test of
Fluid and Crystallized Intelligence (BEFKI; Wilhelm,
Schroeders, & Schipolowski, 2014). Fluid
intelligence was measured with three subtests for
figural, verbal, and numeric content (16 items each).

Mathematics
achievement was measured by two tests of the
domains “number” and “functional relations.”
German achievement was measured by two tests
of reading and listening comprehension

We used data on school grades in the subjects
German and mathematics that were
obtained at pretest and posttest, and recoded so
that higher values indicated better grades.

The Family and Child Experiences Survey (FACES)  

we focus on the first two waves of
data collection (Fall 2009 and Spring 2010), as these
waves capture the Head Start year. 

During the spring of 2010, parents were asked,
“Approximately how many days has [CHILD]
been absent since the beginning of the school
year?” 

First, children’s language skills were measured using
the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (Dunn &
Dunn, 1997; Fall a = .97 and Spring a = .95).

 Next, two subscales from the Woodcock–
Johnson (Woodcock, McGrew, & Mather, 2001), the
Letter Word Identification (Fall 2009: a = .85 and
Spring 2010: a = .83) and Spelling Word (Fall 2009:
a = .79 and Spring 2010: a = .83), were administered
to children to capture their literacy skills.

 Finally, children’s math
skills were directly assessed with the Woodcock–
Johnson Applied Problems subscale et al., 2001; Fall 2009: a = .87 and Spring 2010:
a = .89).

During the spring of 2010, all Head Start classrooms
were observed and rated on the Classroom
Assessment Scoring System (CLASS; Pianta, La
Paro, & Hamre, 2008).

This report is drawn from a larger longitudinal
investigation of adolescent social development in
familial and peer contexts. 

AAI and Q-Set (Ages 14 and 24)
This structured interview probes individuals’
descriptions of their childhood relationships with
parents in both abstract terms and with requests
for specific supporting memories

Maternal Supportive Behavior (Ages 13 and 16)
Adolescents participated in an 8-min supportive
behavior interaction task with their mothers

Parental Psychological Control (Ages 14 and 16/17)
Adolescents completed the Psychological Control
versus Psychological Autonomy subscale of the
Childhood Report of Parenting Behavior Inventory
assessing the degree to which mothers and fathers
use guilt, love withdrawal, or other autonomyundermining
methods to control adolescents’
behavior 

Interparental Hostile Conflict (Age 13)
Hostile conflict between parents was reported by
both parents 

Popularity (Age 14)
Adolescent popularity was assessed using a limited
nomination sociometric procedure. 

Close Peer Supportive Behavior (Ages 14, 16/17)
Adolescents participated in an 8-min interaction
task with their closest friend,

Close Peer Collaborative Behavior and Hostile Behavior

 Approximately
two thirds of the children watched videos in
which informants made claims about events; after
each video children judged the likelihood that those
events could really occur.  Belief ratings were scored such that
0 = very sure the event could not happen, 0.33 = a
little sure the event could not happen, 0.66 = a little
sure the event could happen, and 1.00 = very sure
the event could happen.

The final third of the
sample served as a baseline comparison group—these children
were asked identical questions about whether
the events could really occur but did not receive
testimony.

One hundred and thirty caregiver–toddler dyads
were recruited via flyers and word of mouth from
the New York City metropolitan area or the Central
District of Israel. The Americans participated at a
children’s museum or in a laboratory setting, and
all Israelis participated in their homes.

Coviewing Task: The dyads viewed a slideshow consisting of 12
images; The stimuli were presented via keynote
A camera was positioned above
the participants’ head giving a bird’s-eye view of
the area between the participants and the computer
screen.

Story Construction Task: Caregivers were shown to a child-friendly table
and chair set, and told, “Please use these tiles any
way you like to create a story for your child.” They were then handed the stack of tiles.  The interactions were recorded using a
camera positioned to provide a bird’s-eye view.

The data for Part 1 came from Waves 5,
6, and 7 of the NLS, that we refer to here as T1, T2,
and T3, respectively. In each wave, the longitudinal
core and their classmates were invited to participate
in a classroom data collection session at school (45–
60 min).

Part 2 regarded associating the longitudinal clusters
identified in Part 1 (across T1–T3) with the participant
roles of bullying determined at T4

At T1, participants completed the measures on
paper. At T2–T4, data were collected by means of
computerized assessments. The research assistants
provided each child with a minilaptop computer
that they used to fill in the questionnaire in their
own classroom.

Participants included 243 families (mother, intimate
partner, and preschool child)

The longitudinal design consisted of three annual
measurement occasions


At Wave 1, mothers completed the Family Instability
Questionnaire 

maternal report at
Waves 1 and 2 on the Callousness scale of the
Inventory of Callous-Unemotional Traits

At Waves 1 and 2, children completed a revised
version of the MacArthur Story Stem Battery
(MSSB-R; Cummings et al., 2008). The MSSB-R consists
of a series of story stems indexing conflicts
and adversity in each of three family relationship
subsystems: (a) mother–father (i.e., two stories:
angry parental conflicts over losing keys and getting
home later than expected), (b) mother–child
(i.e., two stories: reunion following extensive separation,
child injury after violating maternal instructions),
and (c) father–child (i.e., two stories: reunion
following extensive separation, child injury after
violating paternal instructions). In depicting the
story stems, experimenters used animated voices,
various toy props, and action figures depicting
Family Instability and School Adjustment 1197
family members. After each story stem, children
completed the stories with the action figures, props,
and, when necessary, probes to maximize the richness
of the narrative responses. - Coders assessed each of the six stories along two
scales ranging from 1 (negligible) to 7 (high)

Teacher reports on three scales from the
MacArthur Health and Behavior Questionnaire
(HBQ; Ablow et al., 1999) were used as indicators of
a latent construct of children’s school adjustment at
Waves 1 and 3.

Some received specific instructions and some did not

LEGO Free Play
Dyads in both groups were then given 5 min to
play with a collection of about 150 LEGO pieces.

LEGO Construction
Mothers were given a booklet that showed 10
target LEGO structures and told that they would
have 10 min to play together with their child to
build as many of the structures as they could.

Spatial language was coded from transcripts of
the play sessions; all other behaviors were coded
from videotaped recordings.

The majority of families were assessed at home.
However, 35% of gay father families and 42% of
lesbian mother families were assessed by Skype
because of the geographical distance from the
researchers. 

Quality of Parenting
Each parent was interviewed using an adaptation
of a semistructured interview designed to
assess quality of parenting that has been validated
against observational 

Parent–Child Interaction
Within each family, each parent–child dyad participated
in an observational assessment of parent–
child interaction. 
  In order to avoid practice effects,
the Etch-A-Sketch task (Stevenson-Hinde & Shouldice,
1995) was used with the parent who spent
most time with the child, 
  and the Co-Construction task (Steele et al., 2007) was used with the other parent

Perceived Stigma
Perceived stigma was measured using the personalized
stigma subscale of a measure originally
developed by Berger, Ferrans, and Lashley (2001) to
assess HIV-related stigma and later modified for
the assessment of stigma associated with being gay

Children’s Adjustment
The presence of children’s emotional and behavioral
difficulties was assessed with the Strengths
and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ; Goodman,
1994, 1997) administered to each parent to produce
total scores of internalizing problems and externalizing
problems 

The children’s externalizing and internalizing
problems were also assessed during the interview
with the parent who spent most time with the child
or a parent selected at random in the families in
which parenting was shared equally using a standardized
procedure

Participants were drawn from a larger sample of
5,991 sixth-grade students 

School ethnic diversity. School ethnic diversity
was measured based on school-level ethnicity data
collected from the CDE and using Simpson’s (1949)
diversity index:

Proportion same-ethnic peers in school. To be
able to take into account the size of participants’
ethnic group, we relied on school-level race/ethnicity
data from the CDE Web site.

Parent education. As a proxy for student SES,
the parent or guardian with whom the student
lived was asked to complete a measure indicating
their highest level of education

Teacher-rated academic engagement. The extent
to which students are engaged in their academic
classes may be related to feelings of social vulnerability
(Juvonen et al., 2006). We therefore controlled
for teacher ratings of students’ engagement in one
of their classes. For each participant, we recruited
one sixth-grade teacher, who rated that student on
the five-item Teacher Report of Engagement Questionnaire
(Wellborn & Connell, 1991).

Perceived school safety. The six-item school
safety subscale from the Effective School Battery
(Gottfredson, 1986) was used to assess how safe
students felt in school.

Self-perceived peer victimization. Perceptions of
personal experiences of victimization by peers were
measured using a modified four-item version of the
Peer Victimization Survey

Loneliness. Relying on five items of the measure
developed by Asher and Wheeler (1985), we
1272 Juvonen, Kogachi, and Graham
assessed loneliness and social dissatisfaction.

Perceptions of teachers’ fair and equal treatment.
To capture student perceptions of teachers’
fair and equal treatment of all ethnic groups, we
relied on three items from the School Interracial Climate
Scale (Green, Adams, & Turner, 1988) that
examine the extent to which youth felt that the
teachers in their school treated all students the
same

Ethnic out-group distance. Ethnic out-group distance
was computed using 16 items assessing the
degree to which students wanted to associate with

Study 1

Children completed a childappropriate
version of the COG-ED, adapted from
Westbrook et al. (2013). The COG-ED, which was
run with E-Prime 2 (Psychology Software Tools,
Pittsburgh, PA)


Child adaptation of the cognitive effort discounting (COG-ED) paradigm. (A) In the first phase, children experienced three Nback
tasks of increasing difficulty, 1-back (blue game—low difficulty), 2-back (red game—intermediate difficulty), and 3-back (green
game—high difficulty). They had to press a button when the current picture matched the picture presented one, two, or three trials back,
respectively. (B) In the second phase, children had to choose between the easy 1-back task for a smaller reward (left) and a harder task
(either 2- or 3-back) for a greater reward (right) (2 runs of 6 choices each).

Finally, in Phase 3, children played short series
(16 pictures) of N-back tasks corresponding to two
of their choices (one from each choice run) and
were told how many points they accumulated.

Bilateral pupil dilation was recorded while children
played the three N-back tasks in Phase 1 with a
Tobii TX300 eye tracker


Study 2

A trained experimenter tested children individually
in a quiet room of their after-school club. Children
first rated the attractiveness of potential prizes
(stationary items) on a 5-point Likert scale

They then completed the same
COG-ED paradigm as in Study 1, except that pupil
dilation was not recorded during the game. As a
consequence, the 10-s fixation cross before each run
in Phase 1 was removed. Children completed COGED
on a laptop and entered responses by pressing
the “0” key on the keyboard instead of a gamepad
button

parent–child dyads
 
Parents and
children took part in a session lasting up to
90 min in an observation laboratory at each university. 

Children’s False Belief Understanding
The children completed four tasks designed to
measure individual differences in false belief understanding.

Children’s Language Ability
the Bus Story Test (Renfrew, 1997; Stokes & Wong,
1996).

Children’s Nonverbal Ability
To provide an index of nonverbal ability, the
children in both sites completed the object assembly
task from the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale
of Intelligence (Wechsler, 2003). In this task, participants
were required to assemble a set of twodimensional
puzzles depicting cartoon images of
objects (e.g., bird, clock, car, fish). 

Parental Mind-Mindedness
Consistent with previous studies of preschoolaged
children, we used a brief interview to obtain a
representational measure of parental mind-mindedness
(Meins & Fernyhough, 2015). Parents’ responses were recorded using a digital
recording device and later transcribed verbatim.

Preschool Oral Narrative Skill
Children’s oral narratives were measured when
children were 48 months old using a story generation
task with a wordless book as a prop. Children were prompted by a researcher to look
at the pictures and tell a story after looking through the book.

Narratives were audio recorded and transcribed for scoring.

Reading Comprehension
The Woodcock–Johnson Psycho-Educational Battery–Revised
(WJ–R; Woodcock & Johnson, 1989)
was administered during laboratory visits to assess
children’s reading comprehension.  The current study used
the passage comprehension subtest to measure children’s
reading comprehension each year from first
to sixth grades.

Quality of the home environment. The quality of the home environment
was measured using the Home Observation for
Oral Narratives and Reading Achievement 1333
Measurement of the Environment (HOME; Caldwell
& Bradley, 1984) The
HOME is a 45-item semistructured observation and
interview with six subscales: emotional and verbal
responsiveness of the parent, acceptance of the
child’s behavior, organization of the environment,
provision of appropriate play materials, maternal
involvement with the child, and variety in daily
experience

Maternal education
 The level of mother’s education
was measured as a continuous variable of the number
of years of education at study entry

Decoding skill. Children’s decoding skills were
used as a covariate to account for the association
between decoding and reading skills (Reese, Suggate,
et al., 2010). To measure children’s decoding
skills, the letter–word identification subtest of the
WJ–R (Woodcock & Johnson, 1989) was used

structured interviews were conducted to
assess children’s moral and conventional judgments.
Interview scripts and all visual stimuli are
included in Appendix S1.

Story Stimuli
Children were presented with four hypothetical
vignettes depicting everyday moral and conventional
transgressions (two each). Each vignette presentation consisted of four story
pictures: rule introduction, actor goal, transgression,
and outcome

Initial Judgments
After each transgression, children’s initial judgments
of the act’s acceptability were assessed

Reactive Aggression
Teachers reported on children’s reactive aggression
using six items from the physical and relational
subscales of the Preschool Proactive and Reactive
Aggression–Teacher Report (PPRA–T; Ostrov &
Crick, 2007). I

Proactive Aggression
Teachers also completed proactive subscales
from the PPRA–T.

Participating children were interviewed
individually in a separate area of their
school or day care. Most teachers (14 of 18) completed
online surveys regarding children’s behavior;
the rest completed paper surveys.
Child interviews were conducted on an iPad
using the online survey software SurveyGizmo. This
allowed for an interactive experience where children
were able to point and choose different
answer responses

Only adolescents who returned a signed parental
consent form, a completed mother questionnaire,
and completed an assent form were given a
student questionnaire to complete in designated
rooms after school.

Behavioral preferences. For brevity, a three-item
version of the original nine-item European American
orientation (sub)scale from the Acculturation
