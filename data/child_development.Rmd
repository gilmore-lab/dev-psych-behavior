Parental and child sociodemographic characteristics
were collected through questionnaires administered
by interviewers. 

Children’s cognitive and motor development at
4 years was assessed through the McCarthy Scales
of Children’s Abilities (MSCA; MacCarthy, 1972). In person

Information on children’s ADHD difficulties was
gathered through the ADHD test (ADHDT; Gilliam,
1995), which was completed by the participants’
mothers.

We utilized data from a longitudinal study on student
achievement and cognitive ability conducted
in Berlin, Germany from the beginning of the
school year 2008–2009 until the end of school year
2009–2010. 

We used data from the pretest and the
posttest (cognitive abilities and student achievement),
as well as the second testing session (IE) that
took place on average 41 days after the pretest
(SD = 6.24). 

We
used an 18-item measure of IE (see Wilhelm et al.,
2003 for details). Students rated these items on a 6-
point scale ranging from 1 (do not agree at all) to 6

Fluid and crystallized intelligence were measured
at pretest and posttest with the Berlin Test of
Fluid and Crystallized Intelligence (BEFKI; Wilhelm,
Schroeders, & Schipolowski, 2014). Fluid
intelligence was measured with three subtests for
figural, verbal, and numeric content (16 items each).

Mathematics
achievement was measured by two tests of the
domains “number” and “functional relations.”
German achievement was measured by two tests
of reading and listening comprehension

We used data on school grades in the subjects
German and mathematics that were
obtained at pretest and posttest, and recoded so
that higher values indicated better grades.

The Family and Child Experiences Survey (FACES)  

we focus on the first two waves of
data collection (Fall 2009 and Spring 2010), as these
waves capture the Head Start year. 

During the spring of 2010, parents were asked,
“Approximately how many days has [CHILD]
been absent since the beginning of the school
year?” 

First, children’s language skills were measured using
the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (Dunn &
Dunn, 1997; Fall a = .97 and Spring a = .95).

 Next, two subscales from the Woodcock–
Johnson (Woodcock, McGrew, & Mather, 2001), the
Letter Word Identification (Fall 2009: a = .85 and
Spring 2010: a = .83) and Spelling Word (Fall 2009:
a = .79 and Spring 2010: a = .83), were administered
to children to capture their literacy skills.

 Finally, children’s math
skills were directly assessed with the Woodcock–
Johnson Applied Problems subscale et al., 2001; Fall 2009: a = .87 and Spring 2010:
a = .89).

During the spring of 2010, all Head Start classrooms
were observed and rated on the Classroom
Assessment Scoring System (CLASS; Pianta, La
Paro, & Hamre, 2008).

video-recorded observational assessment of parent–
child interaction and an audio-recorded standardized
interview that lasted approximately 1.5 hr.

A free play task was used to obtain an observational
assessment of mother–infant and father–infant
interaction. Each parent was instructed to play
with the infant for 10 min in whatever manner and
using whichever toys, they used when they usually
played together. The session was video recorded
and coded using the fourth edition of the Emotional
Availability (EA) Scales (Biringen, 2008). EA refers
to the capacity of a dyad to share an emotionally
healthy relationship 

Mothers and fathers were interviewed separately
using an adaptation of the Parent Development
Interview (PDI
